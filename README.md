 Project Overview

 Objective
Create a Java program to manage student grades, calculate average grades, and display overall performance with letter grades or GPA.

 Components
1. User Input: Capture grades for different subjects or assignments.
2. Grade Calculation: Calculate the average grade.
3. Display Results: Show the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA.
4. Additional Features: Handle multiple students, input validation, and continuous input.

 Steps

1. Setup Development Environment
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK).
   - Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or use a simple text editor with command-line tools.

2. Create the Main Class
   - Create a Java class (e.g., `GradeManager`).

3. Capture User Input
   - Use `Scanner` class to read input from the user.

4. Store Grades
   - Use an array or ArrayList to store grades for different subjects or assignments.

5. Calculate Average Grade
   - Sum the grades and divide by the number of subjects to find the average.

6. Determine Letter Grade or GPA
   - Convert the average grade to a letter grade or GPA based on a predefined scale.

7. Display Results
   - Print the average grade, letter grade, and GPA to the console.

8. Handle Errors
   - Include basic error handling for invalid input.
